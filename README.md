This is a set of script compilers for the PSP game `STEINS;GATE (ULJM05887)`. 

You can use these tools to create an English Patch for the PSP Game.

A proof-of-concept patch is provided with these scripts to show how it works. Example:

> **Note to self:** We should try to build one of these, and provide an `.xdelta` in a Github Releases file.

## Tips

RikuKH3's hacks make it possible to inject text without restrictions into the script. This makes a complete translation of the PSP game possible.

* Use `<LINE>` for linebreaks.
* To make changed talker's name display correctly you need to change it in `DATA.BIN` as well.
